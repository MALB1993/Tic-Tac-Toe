# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game can be played both in single-player mode against the computer and in multiplayer mode against another player. It offers a simple and intuitive user interface, clearly indicating wins, losses, and draws. Additionally, the game provides a reset button for starting a new game without needing to reload the page. The design is responsive and optimized for various devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Technologies Used
- HTML and CSS for user interface design.
- JavaScript for game logic and user interactions.
- Bootstrap framework for responsive design (optional).
